# üß™ Personal Projects Repository

Welcome! This repository houses a collection of personal data analysis projects focused on clinical and public health datasets. Each project folder contains its own `README.md` with more detailed context, methods, and code.

The goal of these projects is to explore meaningful patterns in health-related data and strengthen my skills in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization‚Äîespecially as I pivot into clinical data analytics.
